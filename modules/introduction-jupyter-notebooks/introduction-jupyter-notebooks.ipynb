    "Jupyter notebooks are a type of Python computing environment designed to provide a well-formatted interactive document. These notebooks often serve as the basis for scientific computing or data analysis in Python and can be a powerful tool for prototyping, documentation, and education. This module will provide a quick introduction to working with Jupyter notebooks (the same principles apply if you're working in Google Colab) and some additional tricks to help improve your experience."

    "Unlike a Python text file or another document you may be familiar with, Jupyter notebooks are *modular*.

Each cell generally comes in one of two flavors (there are other types of cells, but they are not necessary for working:\n",

    "Cells of different types can be interspersed throughout a document, allowing you to write code and associated commentary in a single, integrated document. While this format may be initially unfamilliar, it will eventually become second nature as you continue working with future notebooks.

    "### Markdown Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, **Markdown cells** are used for adding textual comments like other word documents or web pages. If you have any descriptions that wouldn't work as a code comment or want more complex formatting like tables, images, or hyperlinks, you will be using a Markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells come in two states: **rendered** and **editing**. In rendered form, Markdown cells appear as if they were a rich text document or webpage, complete with fancy formatting (bold, italics), headers, and other stylizations. If you try to single-click on a Markdown cell, you should notice that a cursor is not inserted and that you actually *cannot edit the text*. To edit the text, you will have to double-click on the cell. This action will change the state to the *editing* state. The first thing you will notice is that *most* of the formatting will have disappeared, and the text now contains additional symbols or details. If you click somewhere in the cell, you will *now* see the editor cursor and edit the text. To switch the Markdown cell back to the rendered state, you can either use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Control-Enter`: Change the cell to the rendered state\n",

    "As the name of the cell type indicates, Jupyter notebooks use a syntax called **Markdown** for formatting text. Instead of using a user interface or hotkeys to format text, you use a combination of symbols associated with the type of formatting you want. Below is a table of the most common Markdown formatting that you may need. If you need to include equations or other mathematical symbols, Jupyter notebooks support mathematics formatting via MathJax. Working with Markdown can take time to get used to but will eventually become second nature.\n",
